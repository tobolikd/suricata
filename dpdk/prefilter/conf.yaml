      #     - "mempool-size / 1.5"
      # It is advised to choose cache_size to have "mempool-size modulo cache_size == 0".
      # If this is not the case, some elements will always stay in the pool and will never be used.
      # The cache can be disabled if the cache_size argument is set to 0, can be useful to avoid losing objects in cache
      # If the value is empty or set to "auto", Suricata will attempt to set cache size of the mempool to a value
      # that matches the previously mentioned recommendations
